          For every JavaScript or PHP project, <strong>VSCode is my go-to choice</strong>. Never regreted leaving Atom ecosystem... VSCode is by far the best including IntelliSense.<br />I use Ahmad Awais' <strong>Shades of Purple VSCode theme</strong> that looks incredibly cool...

          <strong>*</strong> I use <strong>Hyper Terminal</strong> instead of the normal OSX terminal. It does face few issues, but it's great once solved.&nbsp;ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/><strong>*</strong> I have recently switched to <em><strong>ohmyzsh</strong></em> and <strong>zsh </strong>for doing terminal operations.<br /><br /><strong>*</strong> I have configured <strong>WesBos' Cobalt2 Theme for HyperTerm </strong>which uses <strong>Powerline fonts for terminal</strong>.

          <strong>*</strong> For learning JavaScript and Node.JS, I have always <strong>watched YouTube tutorials</strong> and preferred not buying premium courses.<br /><br /><strong>*</strong> Recently, I completed <strong>WesBos' Advanced React course</strong> to learn about React.JS, Next.JS, and GraphQL/Prisma.<br /><br /><strong>* </strong>Reading a lot of blog posts helped me a ton to learn things by myself. <strong>Will list many here soon</strong>!
